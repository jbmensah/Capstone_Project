Key Changes:
Explicit Password Handling:

The password field is explicitly handled in both create_user and create_superuser methods.
The set_password method is used to ensure passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, enhancing security.
A check is added to ensure that a password is provided during user creation. If the password is None, an error is raised.
Optimization in create_superuser:

The create_superuser method now calls create_user with the necessary flags for is_staff and is_superuser. This removes the need for redundant save() calls.
Custom User Model:

The username field has been removed as itâ€™s not needed for authentication (email is used instead).
The custom user manager (UserManager) is explicitly set for handling user creation and management.
Saving with using=self._db:

For more advanced use cases where Django uses multiple databases, save(using=self._db) ensures that the save operation is explicitly tied to the current database configuration.
This updated models.py ensures proper password handling, aligns with best practices for user management, and optimizes the superuser creation process. Let me know if you need further adjustments or explanations!
