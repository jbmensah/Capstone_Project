Key Changes:
Token Retrieval from Authorization Header:

The token is first checked in the Authorization header (with a Bearer prefix). If it's missing there, it falls back to checking the cookies.
Expanded JWT Error Handling:

Added exception handling for different types of JWT errors:
ExpiredSignatureError: For expired tokens.
DecodeError: For improperly formatted or corrupted tokens.
InvalidTokenError: For invalid tokens that can't be trusted.
Validation for Missing User:

After decoding the token, if the user isn't found in the database (user is None), an authentication failure is raised.
This version of CustomUserAuthentication handles both token storage methods and provides better security and clarity around errors. It should be more robust for real-world usage. Let me know if you have questions or need further adjustments!
