Key Updates:
RegisterApi Improvements:

The registration endpoint now directly uses the UserSerializer and saves the user if validation is successful.
After user creation, the serialized data is returned with an HTTP status 201 Created for clarity.
LoginApi Enhancements:

This API now handles JWT creation and sets it in an HttpOnly cookie to secure the token from JavaScript access.
Added a validation check for missing email or password fields, raising an appropriate authentication failure error.
The response includes a message, and the JWT token is set in the cookie to avoid returning it in the response body (improving security).
UserApi Adjustments:

The user information is fetched through the authenticated request user (request.user) and serialized with UserSerializer.
The authentication_classes and permission_classes are used to ensure only authenticated users can access this endpoint.
LogoutApi Fixes:

Logs out the user by deleting the jwt cookie.
A 200 OK response is returned with a clear message.
Why These Changes Matter:
Security: The use of HttpOnly cookies for JWT tokens ensures that JavaScript cannot access tokens, which adds a layer of protection against XSS attacks.
Consistency: Status codes (201 Created for registration, 200 OK for successful login and logout) are used to provide accurate HTTP responses.
Error Handling: Improved error handling with raise_exception=True and exceptions.AuthenticationFailed, making it easier for clients to handle authentication errors.
Code Clarity: The APIs are simplified and adhere to clean coding principles, making the logic easy to follow and maintain.
This updated code is ready for real-world deployment, ensuring good security practices and proper handling of user authentication. Let me know if you have further questions or need help with another aspect of the project!
